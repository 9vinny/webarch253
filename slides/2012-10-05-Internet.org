* The Web Is Built On The Internet :slide:

* We Use These Phrases :slide:
  + "Connects to server"
  + "Sends response to client"
  + "Closes the connection"
What do they mean?

* Internet Architecture is Composable :slide:two_col:
[[file:img/composable_parts_meme.gif]]
  + Emphasize flexibility
  + Allow for growth, incremental adoption
  + Interchangeable parts

* Two Computers Need to Communicate :slide:
  + String a wire between them
  + Send bits across
  + Wait for response?
** Imagine :notes:
   + A time before the Internet and Web
   + Wire could be connected in anyway
   + Bit could be sent in anyway
   + Other computer may respond, may not

* Three Computers Need to Communicate :slide:
Get more wire
[[file:img/3c-communication.png]]
** Wires :notes:
   + Multiple wires between computers?
     + One sending, one receiving?
   + Each computer hooked up to every other, no message passing
   + Mostly workable

* Network :slide:two_col:
[[file:img/3c-communication.png]]
  + Now we have a network
  + Mostly computer-to-computer
  + How to we communicate between networks?

* ARPANET :: Network :slide:two_col:
  + Circuit Switching -> Packet Switching
  + Relied on Interface Message Processors (IMPs)
  + Government, no commercial traffic
[[file:img/Leonard-Kleinrock-and-IMP1.png]]
** Details :notes:
   + Installation planned at 9 months
   + Speed 50 kbit/second (home cable is 245x faster)
     + loading yelp.com would take ~19 seconds
     + but wouldn't have fit into memory

* Network Types :slide:
  + ARPANET
  + Satellite Packet Networks
  + Radio Packet Networks
  + "two tin cans and a string"
** Communication :notes:
   + Can't rely on the sophistication of the carrier network
   + Can't all be carrying around IMPs
   + But we'd still like to send packets of data over some link
   + And we'd like to get data from ARPANET all the way to the cans

* Internet Protocol :slide:
  + Where is the destination? (host addressing)
  + How do I get there? (routing)
  + Stateless!
** IP :notes:
   + Best effort delivery: send it off and hope for the best
   + Don't even guaruntee we got the same data!
   + Very simple, but flexible enough to build on top of
   + But one of the the first things stipualted about the Web was we either
     expect the data to show up, or see an error. How does that happen?

* Packets travel over networks :slide:two_col:
  + Packets send to Yelp from ischool
  + Destination is specified with a number (IP address)
  + Routing is done by forwarding to the next best network
[[file:img/ip-communication.png]]
** Routing Details :notes:
   + We want to send data to Yelp. But where is Yelp?
   + Happens to be in SF, but what if it moves?
   + Networks hand off to the next network it thinks is "closer" to Yelp
   + That network hands it off... etc.
   + Until we get to Yelp
   + Lots of problems can happen:
     + No route to host
     + It can go different ways

* IP Address :slide:
  + Numbers, often represented as "dotted decimal" (199.255.189.160)
  + But can also be represented as just a number (3355426208)
  + IPs assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
** IPv4 notation :notes:
   + "IP" short for "IP Address"
   + "dotted quads"
   + IP version 4 : 32 bit, IPv6 : 128 bit
   + IANA typically assigns ranges, then delegated out
   + ischool gets an IP from a range assigned to Berkeley, which has a range
     assigned to UC system (example)
