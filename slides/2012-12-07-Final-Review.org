* Final Review :slide:
 + Project 2 Due
  + Final: Dec 14
    + Similar to Midterm
    + All topics, emphasis on post-midterm

* IP :slide:
  + What protocol does Telnet speak?
  + How does a data packet get from here to Yelp?
  + What is an IP address?
  + What does TCP/IP stand for?
** Answers :notes:
   + TCP/IP
   + Through intermediate hops, eg ischool router, Berkeley TelCo, Yelp
     Datacenter, Yelp
   + Numerical identifier of a logical host
   + Transmission Control Protocol, Internet Protocol

* TCP Provides? :slide:
  + Correctness :: __
  + Reliability :: __
  + Ordering :: __
  + Congestion :: __
** Answers :notes:
   + An IP packet has the data it was sent with
   + A packet either arrives or we notice it failed
   + Packets arrive in the order they were sent
   + Stop sending so quickly if there are failures, or ramp up when there are
     none

* DNS :slide:
  + What does DNS stand for?
  + DNS maps _________ to ____________
  + What does TLD stand for?
  + What is the TLD?
    + cnn.com
    + berkeely.edu
    + craigslist.org
    + bankofamerica.secure
  + Does TCP/IP know about hostnames?
** Answers :notes:
   + Domain Name Service
   + Hosts to IPs
   + Top Level Domain
   + com, edu, org, secure

* Site Performance :slide:
  + Why does the browser make multiple requests for 1 page?
  + What does =Content-Encoding: gzip= mean?
  + Why is bundling resources necessary?
  + RESTful states "Responses must ... define themselves as cacheable, or not".
    How does this help performance?
  + What are the trade-offs for caching all the JS ever needed on the site, vs
    breaking it up across each page?
  + What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?
** Answers :notes:
   + Other resources: pictures, CSS, javascript
   + Means message body is compressed
   + Typically developed separately, but should combine for production
     performance
   + Browsers don't need to constantly reload resources like JS
   + Initial slow experience, but fast subsequent vs. constant moderate
     performance
   + Stores resources closer to users so their downloads are faster.

* Data Storage :slide:
  + If a RESTful service is stateless, where is state stored?
  + What are some of the problems with our =app.py= "database"?
  + SQL is a declarative language.  What other web languages are declarative?
  + ACID properties:
    + Atomicity :: __
    + Consistency :: __
    + Isolation :: __
    + Durability :: __
  + What is database Replication?
  + What is the minimal API for a key/value store?
** Answers :notes:
   + A database, or data store
   + Only lives on one server, easily deleted, can't be scaled, can't use
     complex query logic, no enforced types,...
   + HTML, CSS
   + Applied all or none, constraints in the DB are upheld, transations don't
     interact with one another, once we return "saved" contents are on disk
   + Storing multiple copies of the same data
   + =get= =put=

* Search :slide:
  + Components:
    + Crawling :: __
    + Indexing :: __
    + Searching :: __
  + What is the "crawling frontier"?
  + An inverted index maps ____ to ____
  + What is PageRank?
** Answers :notes:
   + "spider" to download and extract content
   + Store words or features associated with a document
   + Match queries or intent with documents
   + The pages we know about but haven't downloaded yet
   + words/features to documents/pages
   + Way of measuring a page's popularity or relevance

* SEO & Microdata :slide:
  + When improving search rank, #1 priority is a) search engine, or b) user?
  + With regard to user intent, why might "Pool" be a difficult query on Yelp?
  + How can you communicate to a search engine that you do not want some page indexed?
  + How is this enforced?
  + Why is semantic HTML important for both accessibility and SEO?
  + What type of content needs a =nofollow= attribute?
** Answers :notes:
   + user!
   + pool hall, pool cleaning, lap pools
   + =robots.txt=
   + It is not: spiders can still download those pages
   + content can be transmitted in alternate ways (screen reader), content can
     be understood and interpreted by machine

* Mobile :slide:
  + For mobile development, which technologies are still used: HTML, CSS,
    Javascript, HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS
  + What are the trade-offs for mobile web vs. mobile app?
  + How are HTML5 and mobile web development related?
  + What is the Mobile First philosophy?
  + Is this the same as Mobile Only?
** Answers :notes:
   + All of them!
   + some trade-offs:
     + performance vs universal compatibility
     + specialized UI vs quick development with standard elements
     + access to special hardware features vs generic APIs
   + HTML5 contains many features geared toward handling mobile devices,
     though is a general standard for all browsers.
   + Target new web applications at mobile devices first to focus efforts and
     ensure a great mobile experience
   + No! Most web apps need a desktop version as well for best UX

* Mobile Features :slide:
  + What are =media= queries in CSS?
  + Why do some printed web pages look different on screen?
  + Can web pages use your geolocation?
** Answers :notes:
   + A more advanced way to target CSS rules to the devices displaying content.
     Eg. being able to specify dimensions of the device instead of just its type
   + Their stylesheet specifies a =media=printer= rule
   + Yes, using JS geolocation API

* Data :slide:
  + What advantages do web companies have with regard to using data to drive
    products?
  + What types of things might you need to "scrub" logs for?
  + What types of things should you have in your logs?
** Answers :notes:
   + Some advantages:
     + Easier to instrument user behavior
     + Already have technical employees to write software models
     + Easier to automatically change product behavior based on user models
   + Incorrect datetime formats, software bug that was outputing wrong user IDs
     or cookies, or missing data
   + datetime, any ID that was displayed on the page, user ID, HTTP request
     (method and path)

* Analysis & Modeling :slide:
  + What are example problems can modeling or machine learning solve?
  + What does "collaborative filtering" do?
  + What are "features" in the example of a spam email?
  + How would you assign the "relevant" label to search results?
  + What are the pros and cons of the MapReduce paradigm?
** Answers :notes:
   + Spam/Ham detection, product recommendations, pricing estimates based on
     features (eg. housing)
   + Recommend related items to users. user-user finds similar users, and
     recommends their preferences; item-item finds similar items to the user's
     preferences and recommends them
   + words appearing in the email, the sender's IP, the sender's email domain
   + One way is marking clicked-on results as relevant
   + Scales up to large amount of data and machines with no change in program,
     but is offline, batch oriented and can require a fixed startup time

* Security :slide:
  + At what size should a company start thinking about security?
  + Why is SSL used to wrap HTTP (ie HTTPS)?
  + What is XSS?
  + Can Javascript access Cookies?
  + When can you trust user input?
  + "Cross Site Referral Forgery" uses a link on one site to perform an action
    on another.  How can you prevent it?
** Answers :notes:
   + Any size!
   + HTTP is a plain text protocol, sending data via this protocol can be viewed
     by any intermediate machine, so is unsafe way to transfer sensitive data.
     SSL enables end-to-end encryption.  Also can be used to verify identity of
     participants.
   + Cross Site Scripting attack: injecting user provided HTML into trusted page
   + Yes, and can send them to untrusted party if they can inject JS
   + Never! Always must escape/clean it
   + Using a POST request and adding a unguessable token to the sensitive form
     as a hidden field

** Johnny Drop Tables :slide:
   + Explain this comic:
[[file:img/exploits_of_a_mom.png]]

[[http://xkcd.com/327/][XKCD]]
** Answer :notes:
   + This is a SQL injection: when entered into the school database, the boy's
     name escaped the context of the INSERT statement and dropped (deleted) the
     student table
