* *HTTP* and *Servers* :slide:

* Servers Return Representation :slide:
  + Homework will be writing code to return HTML
  + How do we decide which HTML to send?
  + How do we use methods and headers?
  + How do we represent errors?

* What resource to return? :slide:
  + How are resources specified?
** With hostname and Path :notes:
   + =people.ischool.berkeley.edu=
   + =/~ashams/i253/index.html=
     + Absolute path?

** Hostname/Path => Resource :slide:
   + http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~ashams/i253/index.html
   + How to specify hostname with HTTP?
   + How to specify path?
   + What method to use?

* Webserver :slide:
  + Associate =/~ashams/i253/index.html= with =/home/ashams/public_html/i253/index.html=
  + Associate  =/~ashams/i253/colors.css= with =/home/ashams/public_html/i253/colors.css=
  + Associate ...
** Gets old :notes:
   + Instead of associating each file...

* Extrapolate :slide:
  + Associate everything in =/~ashams/= with everything in =/home/ashams/public_html/=
  + This is a common feature of most webservers
  + =Apache= the most popular
  [[file:img/wpid-overalld.png]]
** Webserver usage :notes:
   + Apache is an open source webserver, one of the original

* Missing file? :slide:
  + What should we do if we request a file that is not there?
  + Return nothing?
  + Return "Oops!"
** Ambiguous :notes:
   + What about different languages?
   + What about pages that you want to title "Oops!"
   + How to tell the difference between an error and no data?
   + Don't take these for granted. You are the innovators.

* HTTP Response Codes :slide:
  + Numbers are unambiguous, can be read by machines
  + Always return a response code
  + Return text as well for human readability

** HTTP Response Numbers :slide:
   + 200s :: OK
   + 300s :: Redirect
   + 400s :: Client errors
   + 500s :: Server errors

* Demo 200 OK :slide:
